# vue-todo-app

> In this project, I build a Todo app when I study Vue.js with instructor Andre Madarang. This will give me a practical approach to learning how to use Vue.js and its core concepts. How to scaffold our app using Vue CLI and build out our todo functionality while borrowing some features from the official Vue todo MVC.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report

```
